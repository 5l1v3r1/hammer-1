NOTES
=====

Regarding parse_result_t:
If a parse fails, the parse_result_t will be NULL.
If a parse is successful but there's nothing there (i.e., if end_p succeeds), then there's a parse_result_t but its ast is NULL.

Regarding butnot and difference:
There's a "do what I say, not what I do" variation in how we implemented these (versus how jsparse did it). His `butnot` succeeds if p1 and p2 both match and p1's result is longer than p2's, though the comments say it should succeed if p2's result is longer than p1's. Also, his `difference` succeeds if p1 and p2 both match, full stop, returning the result of p2 if p2's result is shorter than p1's or the result of p1 otherwise, though the comments say it should succeed if p2's result is shorter than p1's. Whatever; we're doing what the comments say.
